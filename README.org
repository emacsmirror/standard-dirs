/Standard Dirs/ is an Emacs library to provide platform-specific paths for reading and writing configuration, cache, and other data.
Currently only Linux and macOS are supported.
- On Linux, the directory paths conform to the XDG base directory and XDG user directory specifications as published by the freedesktop.org project.
- On macOS, the directory paths conform to Apple's filesystem documentation [[https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPFileSystem/Articles/WhereToPutFiles.html]["Where to Put Files"]].
